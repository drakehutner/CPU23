an esoteric 23-bit processing unit with a RISC instruction set.

What's the purpose - why create another CPU?
--------------------------------------------

I find the design and complexity of a modern CPU very intriguing.
As a computer engineering student, I want to understand what has to be done in order for a circuit to act as a CPU.
As a tinker, I enjoy developing things from scratch.
A logical result was the creation my very own CPU design.

I'm not intending to make the next big CPU design, useful for everyone and -thing;  I merely try to understand the steps that are necessary to make this work.

Since developing a CPU is a complex, long term project, I try to keep everything as simple as possible. Starting with an elementary instruction set with the minimum of instruction needed to be turing complete and provide at least a bit of  comfort writing assembly.
