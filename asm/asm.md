The CPU23 assembly language.
============================

Each line contains one command.


OpCode
------

The language consists of 32 opcodes, defined be the CPU specifications.
Each opcode is represented by its two or three letter representation.

	NOP RLS SET RST
	ADD SUB	LSL LSR 
	AND OR 	XOR NOT 
	CMP JMP BRA CLL 
	BRS RTS EMW EMR 

Register selection	
------------------

A register can be selected by its name.

	R0 R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 R6 R7 R8 R9
	RX IR SR SP DP PC

A displacement can be added by brackets and an optional comma separated 
displacement. The displacement is always positive.

	Example: 
	[R0]	The value at the address stored in R0.
	[R0,1]	The value at the address+1 stored in R0.

Other than an explicit displacement a pre or post increment or decrement can be 
defined by either + oder - before or after the name.

	Example:
	[R0+]	Read the value at the address stored in R0 and increment R0.
	[-R0]	Decrement R0 and read the value at the address stored in R0.
	
	
Constants
---------

The optional constant in a command word is enclosed in parenthesis.

Values
------

Values can be placed directly between the instructions.
Every value starts with the character #.

Comments
--------

A comment starts with a % and ends with a new line.
